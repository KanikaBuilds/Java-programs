This repository contains a variety of Java programs ranging from beginner-level concepts to interactive GUI-based applications.

The goal of this repo is to:
- Track my learning journey in Java  
- Practice core concepts  
- Build small but meaningful projects  
- Improve my Git, programming, and documentation skills
